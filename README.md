### Hi there 👋


- I'm currently a Research Scientist at Anuttacon. I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2025 and was a visiting research intern at the University of Pennsylvania in 2024.
- My research primarily focuses on 3D/4D perception and reconstruction. During my undergraduate studies, I contributed to projects such as [BAGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11427) and [ProTracker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03220).
- I'm currently exploring efficient representations for 3D structures and complex physical behaviors. If you share an interest in 3D vision research or have ideas to discuss, feel free to reach out via email: tingyang030707@gmail.com.
